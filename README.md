# FastTime App
## Deep Dive Coding Java Android __Salesforce__ Cohort 4

### Aims and Motivations
     What I wanted to accomplish with Fast Time is to buid an application that would use simple classes
     and methods written in Java to be run on Android. This would allow me to learn a lot of basic 
     skills for Java and Android development. 

#### Why choose FastTime?
* To facilitate the completion of the requirements set forth in the course syllabus of the 
Java Android Salesforce Cohort 4 Boot Camp to completion.
* To build a basic application that works to keep track of the last time you ate something. 
* To build a basic application that implements a interval workout timer.
* To build my knowledge, skills, and abilities with Java and Android development.

#### Why is FastTime a potentially or particularly useful or interesting app?
* It's useful to keep track of past fasting events
* It's useful to have a timer for interval workouts on your phone. 
* It's interesting because it's simple and basic and integrates both 
an interval timer with a fasting timer.
* It's an application in which myself and other users can have an audibile timer 
for interval  or round workouts.
 
### Current State of FastTime
     Currently, FastTime has only one main element of two main elements functional.
