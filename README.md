# FastTime App
## Deep Dive Coding Java Android __Salesforce__ Cohort 4

### Aims and Motivations
     What I wanted to accomplish with Fast Time is to buid an application that would use some simple classes
     and methods written in Java to run an app on Android. This would allow me to learn a lot of basic 
     skills for Java and Android development. 

#### Why choose FastTime?
* To facilitate the completion of the requirements set forth in the course syllabus of the 
Java Android Salesforce Cohort 4 Boot Camp to completion.
* To build a basic application that works to keep track of the last time you ate something. 
* To build a basic application that implements a interval workout timer.
* To build my knowledge, skills, and abilities with Java and Android development.

#### Why is FastTime a potentially or particularly useful or interesting app?
* It's useful to keep track of past fasting events
* It's useful to have a timer for interval workouts on your phone. 
* It's interesting because it's simple and basic and integrates both 
an interval timer with a fasting timer.
* It's an application in which myself and other users can have an audibile timer 
for interval  or round workouts.
 
### Current State of FastTime
     Currently, FastTime has basic as outlined in Wire Frames.
     1.) The first is a Gym Timer element that runs an interval sytle workout timer
     2.) The second is a Intermittent Fasting Timer that allows you to track when you are fasting, 
     and for how long you have been fasting for.
     
#### Hit List of deficiencies
* Fast Timer does not allow you when to select to end a fast. 
Timer will only timestamp when you press stop fast button.
* Fast Timer does not allow records to be updated or deleted once entered into database.
* Gym Timer does not make sounds
* Gym Timer does not allow custom selection of workouts.

### List of Android API versions and hardware tested
* Android API 21 platform
* Nexus 5X API 27

### List of 3rd-party libraries used by FastTime
* none

### List of the external services consumed by FastTime
* Google Oauth 2.0

### List of aesthetic/cosmetic improvements that would improve FastTime
* A GUI and Color Style Update to Material Design guidelines.
* A Graph representation of past fasts that can be filtered by timeline. e.g.(week, month, year)
* Better Implementation of Material Design
* More User Friendly Displays.
* Animation Transitions between the fragments. 

### List of functional stretch goals for FastTime
* Bar Chart for Completed Fast Durations. 
* Calendar Display of Completed Fasts.
* being able to make friends and see your friends completed Fasts.
